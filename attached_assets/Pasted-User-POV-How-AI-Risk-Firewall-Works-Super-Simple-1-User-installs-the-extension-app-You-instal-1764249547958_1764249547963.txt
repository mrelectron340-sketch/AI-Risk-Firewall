User POV — How AI Risk Firewall Works (Super Simple)
1️⃣ User installs the extension/app

You install AI Risk Firewall as:

Chrome extension

Mobile crypto wallet plugin

Desktop wallet addon

Nothing complicated.

2️⃣ You open any crypto website → Firewall wakes up automatically

Example:
You click a Telegram link, go to a website like:

“claim-airdrop2025.com”

Normally you have no idea if it’s fake.

But now:

🔥 The AI Firewall scans the website in 1 second.

It checks:

hidden scripts

malicious JS

phishing patterns

fake UI

fake MetaMask popups

domain reputation

contract links on the site

Then it shows a popup:

❌ Danger: This website looks like a phishing site (82% risk)

Blocked to protect your wallet.

You just avoided a scam.

3️⃣ You connect your wallet to a dApp → AI checks if it’s safe

You click “Connect Wallet” on any site.

AI instantly examines:

contract address

token approvals

what permissions the site wants

whether the contract is verified

past hacks

developer history

liquidity locks

Then it shows:

🟡 “Warning: This dApp is asking for unlimited token approval.”

Do you want to continue?

If yes → AI blocks risky permissions automatically.

4️⃣ You try sending tokens → AI checks the receiving wallet

You type:

Send 0.5 ETH to “0x52…a91”

AI checks:

wallet scam reports

blacklist status

number of victims

if it’s a known mixer

if it's linked to drainers

past malicious transactions

Result:

❌ “This wallet is linked to 14 scam transactions.”

Transaction blocked.

You avoid losing funds.

5️⃣ You want to interact with a new token

Example:
A friend says: “buy this meme coin bro”.

You paste the token address.

AI analyses:

liquidity lock

contract owner permissions

minting function (can they rugpull?)

buy/sell taxes

honeypot traps

dev wallet transactions

social hype vs bot activity

Then AI shows:

🟢 Safety Score: 92/100 (Safe)

or

❌ Safety Score: 23/100 (High rug-pull risk)
6️⃣ AI gives you a DAILY PROTECTION REPORT

Every night, AI sends a summary:

🌙 "Today we blocked 3 dangerous actions & flagged 1 risky contract."

You feel protected 24/7 like an antivirus for your crypto.

7️⃣ You receive a Polygon-based “Trust NFT”

This NFT updates automatically.

Shows:

how many scams you avoided

how safe your wallet behaves

your overall wallet reputation ranking

It’s like a crypto safety badge.

Useful for:

exchanges

airdrops

communities

DeFi apps

They trust you more because you’re “verified safe”.

🔗 HOW THE FIREWALL USES POLYGON (Explained VERY Simply)
✔ 1. On-chain risk logs

Every time AI stops a scam:

It stores a small encrypted log on Polygon
("wallet X blocked a phishing website")

This creates a public database of scam patterns.

✔ 2. Trust NFT (SBT)

Your wallet gets a dynamic SoulBound Token:

Higher score = more trust

Lower score = risk warning

DeFi apps can read this to protect users.

✔ 3. Contract Safety Registry

Your app maintains a public list of:

verified safe contracts

known dangerous contracts

suspicious tokens

Stored on Polygon → transparent + decentralized.

⭐ FINAL SUMMARY (User POV)

As a user, you basically get:

🔥 “Antivirus + Firewall for Your Crypto Wallet”

It automatically blocks:

phishing

bad contracts

risky approvals

rug pulls

scam wallets

fake websites

drainer scripts

Everything happens before you lose money.

And everything is made trustless + transparent using Polygon.
