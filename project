🛡️ PROJECT: AI Risk Firewall for Crypto Users
(AI-powered Web3 safety layer for wallets, DApps & transactions)
✅ 1. SIMPLE EXPLANATION (User POV)
🔹 User opens your website/app

Your app works like an AI guardian for crypto users.

🔹 User connects wallet (MetaMask, Backpack, Phantom, etc.)

Once connected:

Whenever the user tries to:

open a suspicious link

connect to a new contract

approve a token

swap on DEX

mint an NFT

sign a message

check a new token

➡️ Your AI instantly checks if it’s safe.

🔹 User sees a “Safety Score” (0–100)

Like:

90+ Safe

60–89 Moderately Risky

0–59 Dangerous — DO NOT PROCEED

🔹 If dangerous → Firewall blocks it

A popup:

“⚠️ HIGH RISK! This contract is a rug-pull pattern. Blocked.”

User avoids losing money.

🔹 If safe → Firewall allows interaction

User continues normally.

🧠 2. HOW THE AI WORKS (AI Analysis Flow)

Your AI does 7 types of checks:

🟣 1. Contract Risk Analysis

AI analyzes the smart contract for:

mint() abuse

drain() functions

blacklist functions

unlimited approvals

centralization (owner has too much control)

hidden backdoors

AI Model Used:
Llama 3 / GPT / Code-LLM fine-tuned on scam contracts.

🟣 2. Token Scam Pattern Detection

AI checks token metadata:

liquidity locked?

contract verified?

trading enabled or disabled?

massive supply mintable?

LP burn?

honeypot behavior?

🟣 3. Wallet Reputation Scoring

AI checks:

Is the wallet part of known scams?

Has it interacted with phishing contracts?

Is it flagged on Etherscan/Polygonscan?

🟣 4. Website Fingerprint

If user clicks a crypto website link:

Fake Uniswap clones

Fake airdrop pages

Fake MetaMask pages

Fake staking dashboards

The AI compares website code with known phishing patterns.

🟣 5. Transaction Simulation

AI runs a simulated transaction to check:

Will the user lose tokens?

Will tokens be stolen?

Will approvals be unlimited?

🟣 6. Rug Pull Probability

AI analyzes:

Developer history

Social activity

Sudden token spikes

Liquidity draining patterns

Ownership transfers

Gives a rug-pull probability score.

🟣 7. On-Chain Risk Logs

All alerts are logged anonymously on Polygon.

This creates:

global safety database

transparent risk reputation system

🔗 3. HOW POLYGON IS USED (CORE BLOCKCHAIN LAYER)

Polygon is not just a payment layer — it provides identity, storage, speed.

Here’s how your app uses Polygon:

🟣 1. On-Chain Risk Logs

Every detected scam is logged to a Polygon smart contract:

address
contractAddress
riskScore
timestamp
typeOfThreat


This becomes the world’s biggest scam-detection database, decentralized.

🟣 2. User Safety NFT (SBT)

Each user gets a Safety Reputation NFT that updates as they avoid scams.

This is soulbound (non-transferable).

It shows:

how safe they are

how many scams they avoided

how their wallet reputation looks to dApps

🟣 3. Smart Contract Scanner

Smart contracts on Polygon are checked using:

Polygonscan API

Your AI audit engine

On-chain logs

This gives instant safety checks.

🟣 4. Privacy-preserving zkProofs

You can integrate Polygon ID to allow users to prove they are clean wallets without revealing identity or balances.

Example:

“Prove your wallet has no scam interactions”
Without revealing any other data.

🧩 4. APP ARCHITECTURE (FULL SYSTEM BLUEPRINT)

    → ML Models (Contract Risk / Website Scanner / Transaction Simulator)
    → Blockchain Layer (Polygon)
        → Risk Logs Contract
        → Safety NFT Contract
        → Verification Contract

🧍‍♂️ 6. USER FLOW (STEP-BY-STEP)
Step 1 — User logs in → Connect wallet
Step 2 — User clicks a crypto link

AI scans the website.

Step 3 — User interacts with a contract

AI scans contract code.

Step 4 — AI calculates risk score

Displayed instantly.

Step 5 — If risky → Interaction blocked

User protected.

Step 6 — If safe → Allow transaction

Smooth secure experience.

Step 7 — Risk logs saved to Polygon

Global threat database improves.

Step 8 — Safety NFT updates

Shows reputation.
